BSLOAD Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BSLOAD downloads 'object' files to the BASIC Stamp, without requiring source
code.  This facilitates field upgrades to Stamp-based products.  Your customer
needs a Stamp cable, the BSLOAD.EXE program, and any .OBJ files which you wish
to supply.

Here's how it works:

	Within your BASIC source code, put BSAVE somewhere.  It is a command
	which doesn't require any arguments.  When you do an ALT-R, a binary
	file named CODE.OBJ gets saved.  This file is the 256-byte binary
	picture of the Stamp's EEPROM.  You will then want to rename the file
	in DOS to some other appropriate name, like maybe 'RELAY.OBJ'.  Keep
	the .OBJ extension, since the downloader assumes this automatically if
	nothing else is given.

	Once an .OBJ file is made, it can be downloaded to a Stamp via DOS by
	typing BSLOAD {filename}.  The file will be downloaded to the Stamp,
	and it runs as normal.  You may wish to make a batch file which
	invokes BSLOAD, after prompting the user to connect the Stamp, etc.
